#SERE for RNA-Seq

SERE [Single-parameter quality control and sample comparison for RNA-Seq] is a simple and reliable statistical method for the global assesment of pairs or large groups of RNA-Seq datasets. The method results in a single number which can be used to determine whether two or more libraries are faithful replicates or globally different. Further details of SERE can be found in [1].
